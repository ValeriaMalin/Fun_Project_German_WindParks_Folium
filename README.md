A dashboard web app template built in Python using Streamlit
# Fun_Project_German_WindParks_Folium
This is a small visualization project of geospatial data


The Aim for the project was to see the perspectives of Wind Energy in Germany with the time. 

The repository consists of 4 Notebooks:
they involved scraping, collection, celaning and preprocessing data, as well as exploratory data analysis.
1. 1_windcrafts_scraping.ipynb  : protocol of WebScraping using BeautifulSoup Biblithek from Wikipedia of multiple table with the information
   for the Wind Crafts (cleaning , foramtting, and merge of data)
2. 2_landkreis_id_scraping.ipynb : Scraping of tables directly as pandas DataFrame , here I had to join the Landkreis ShorName and Nuts 3 ID
3. 3_offshore_windParks_scraping.ipynb : Scraping of the table from WIkipedia , I needed here the coordiantes of the Offshores Wind Parks
4. Mapping_windcrafts.ipynb  : Work with Folum, Marker Cluster for the Offshore WindParks, and two Choropleths layers to show the numbers of the Windcrafts for every Landkreis and their average Age.

The reposititiry contains the script for streamlit app: windpark_app.py. The appy can be deployed on: (https://funprojectgermanwindparksfolium-cufat2h47zdszynqkdpb4w.streamlit.app) 

The repository includes: datasets obtained during the work  - dataset containing all the wind turbines in Germany to 2024, dataset containig all the inforamtion about off-shore windparks, and the datasets containing windparks together with geo-spatial data fpor Landkreises and Bundesl√§nder of Germany.

   Work is on going .... but the dashboiad is to be deployed, it is ready!!!
